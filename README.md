# LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Manipulator Robot - Pick-and-Place Operations

This repository contains MATLAB code for implementing a sequence of **pick-and-place operations** using a LEGO Mindstorms EV3 manipulator robot.

## How to Run

1. **Run `main_chuka.m`**  
   This script executes the full sequence of pick-and-place tasks for the robot.

2. **Run `Chuka_robot.m`**  
   This script showcases the **kinematic models** derived for the robot.

## Project Overview

This project leverages **MATLAB programming** to control the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robot, executing a series of pick-and-place operations. The kinematic models of the robot are used to determine the movements, making it a great demonstration of how MATLAB can be applied in robotics for handling essential manipulation tasks.
